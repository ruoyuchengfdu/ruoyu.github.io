My name is Ruoyu Cheng \(成若玉\).  
I am currently pursuing a master's degree in physics at Fudan University. My research interests are centered on theoretical nuclear physics, including quantum many-body systems, open quantum systems, strong interaction, and nuclear astrophysics. At present, my explorations focus on developing high-performance computational methods.
